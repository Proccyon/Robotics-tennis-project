The tennis environment implementation can be found in TennisEnv.py. Running this file will result
in 20 rounds being played with random agents. Agents are trained in the NeatAgent.py file. Use the
if statements at the bottom to either train a new agent, plot a previous run or rum a trained agent.
See the summaries at the top of the files to see what they do. Also see Demo.mp4 for a demo video.
